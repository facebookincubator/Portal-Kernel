Kernel driver od100
=======================

Supported device:
Occupancy Detection PIR motion sensor module

Data sheet:
Not freely available

Description
-----------
OD100 is a room occupancy detection device based on three passive infra-red
sensors (PIR sensors) and an MCU that takes the ADC measurements of each PIR
sensor. The ADC measurements are used to detect motions. Debounicing is used
to translate the motion into prosence information.

The host device communicates with the od100 via I2C bus. Via sysfs, the host
can enable/disable each PIR sensor and sets the detection range & sensitivity
for each sensor.


SYSFS
-----

device_id
	RO - shows device id in 32 bit hex format with the leading 0x.

firmware_ver
	RO - shows firmware build version in 32 bit hex format with the leading 0x.

sensor_num
	RO - shows number of PIR sensors (i.e. 3).

sensor_range
	RW - list of programmed sensor range values in eight steps (0 through 7).
	     This is meant to help tune the firmware, but can be used to overwrite
	     the firmware programmed values and dynamically change PIR range.

sensor_sensitivity
	RW - list of programmed sensor sensitivity values in eight steps (0 through 7).
	     This is meant to help tune the firmware, but can be used to overwrite
	     the firmware programmed values and dynamically change PIR sensitivity.

sensor_detect
	RO - 32 bit bit-mask value in decimal format that indicates presence detection
	     within the programmed range. The sysfs_notify gets called whenever there
	     is a value change.

	     0 means no presence.
	     1 means presence detected at PIR sensor 0.
	     2 means presence detected at PIR sensor 1.
	     3 means presence detected at PIR sensor 0 and 1.
	     4 means presence detected at PIR sensor 2.
	     5 means presence detected at PIR sensor 0 and 2.
	     6 means presence detected at PIR sensor 1 and 2.
	     7 means presence detected at PIR sensor 0, 1, and 2.

sensor_enable
	RW - 32 bit bit-mask value in decimal format that enables each PIR sensor

	     0 disables all PIR sensors.
	     1 enables PIR sensor 0.
	     2 enables PIR sensor 1.
	     3 enables PIR sensor 0 and 1.
	     4 enables PIR sensor 2.
	     5 enables PIR sensor 0 and 2.
	     6 enables PIR sensor 1 and 2.
	     7 enables PIR sensor 0, 1, and 2.

disable_wake
	RW - write 1 to disable wake up from suspend by driver interrupts
	     wake up enabled by default
	     writing 1 to disable_wake disables wake up
