Bindings for fb_privacy driver
------------------------------------------------------------

Kernel module to communicate with TZ to control privacy state machine of camera/mic/leds.

Required property:
- fb,ledapp_name (string):
	Name of the led control application in TZ that provides the driver
	implementation.

- fb,release_timeout (u32):
	The key handler's short press timeout in ms. If the key is not released
	before the timeout, the event will be considered a long press.

- fb,key_code (u32):
	The Linux code for the key used to toggle privacy. This should be
	the same as the Linux code passed to the actual key handler that
	reports the event to this driver.

Example:
	fb_privacy: fb_privacy {
		fb,ledapp_name = "lp5521";
		fb,release_timeout = <500>;
		fb,key_code = <116>;
	};
